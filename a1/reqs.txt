P1:
	classify wine test set using k-nearest neighbour
	take two file names as cmd args (training, test)
	write a readme.txt describing how to run the program
	report
		class labels of each instance in test, and accuracy of training (k=1)
		compare vs (k=3)
		discuss adv and disadv
		k-fold cross validation where k=5, how do you do it
		three clusters, no class lables. how wyou du group the examples?
	extra: implemement clustering method
		analysis of 3 and 5 (compare to classes)

P2:
	read csv files
		name
		class name	bool
	decision tree learning algorithm
	two command line args (training, test)
	dec tree classifier
		print tree in human-readable format
		use impurity measures
	readme.txt describing how to run program
	report
		classification accuracy
		compare to baseline classifier
		report accuracy on future runs
		explain how to prune, disadvantages, advantages
		why does impurity measure fall off after 2 classes
